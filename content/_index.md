This site provides the Cabinet Office Analysis & Insight team’s guide for coding in analytical projects.

The purpose of this guide is to provide simple advice about how to use code in our analysis. This site is a ‘living document’ that will evolve as our approach develops/changes. While the guide is intended to be language independent, given our practice examples are more likely to be based on using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [R Studio](https://www.r-project.org/). Our approach to coding and analysis is particularly influenced by the [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) approach.

This guide isn’t designed to provide a rulebook of ‘hard’ standards that must be followed, rather it provides advice and general guidelines to using code in analytical projects. There are many other guides and resources developed by others, which provide more detailed information and have influenced this guide. Each person and team also have their own individual style and preferences - this guide is designed to provide some common building blocks so that it is easier for our analysts to work together when coding.
