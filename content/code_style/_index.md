Everyone will write code their own way, and some languages are more prescriptive than others about their approach and conventions.

This section is not a complete style guide, for which we recommend the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html) for R and the appropriate [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for all other languages. Instead, his section sets out some common conventions and approaches that provide general guidelines about writing good code for analysis.
