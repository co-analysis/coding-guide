Analytical projects generally, but especially those using code, should be managed as a project.

A project is a discrete piece of work/analysis that is self-contained and can be run on its own. It may rely on other work, data or specific packages (see dependency management), but assuming you have access to the other work, data or packages you ought to be able to run this code.

Projects should be contained in separate, distinct, and well named, folders. Unless using version control, these project folders should be stored on the network file share. The shared drive or GitHub repository should be the cannonical version of the code.
