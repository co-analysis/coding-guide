# Analytical Coding Guide

::: {.lead-para}
This site provides the Cabinet Office Analysis & Insight team's guide for coding in analytical projects.
:::

The purpose of this guide is to provide simple advice about how to use code in our analysis. It is broken down into three sections: **workflow**, **style** and **output**. This site is a 'living document' that will evolve as our approach develops/changes. While the guide is intended to be language independent, examples are more likely to be based on using [R](https://www.r-project.org) or [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com). Our approach to coding and analysis is particularly influenced by the [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).

In addition to these guidelines, we also have a list of other [resources](resources.html) that provide advice and guidance on coding for analytical projects, many of which have influenced this guide.

## Workflow
Our [workflow](workflow.html) guidelines set out how you should structure and manage code in an analytical project.

1. Project-based working
2. Dependencies and package management
3. Version control (git)
4. QA and code review

## Style
Our [style](style.html) guidelines set out how to write code for a project.

1. Naming conventions
2. Syntax
3. Pipe
4. Comments and documentation
5. Error messages

## Output
Our [output](output.html) guidelines set out some principles for presenting results.

1. Tables
2. Graphs
3. Slide decks
4. Publishing
