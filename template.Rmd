### Section heading
Use the [`govdown`](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/) guidelines to format the body of your text. Use the H1 heading markdown (`# Page Title`) for page title, section headings should use H3 markdown (`### Section Heading`).

### Header info and breadcrumbs
At the top of the markdown template you will see this code:

```
---
output: 
  govdown::govdown_document:
    page_title: "ACG - Workflow"
---
```

This code (`page_title:`) sets the HMTL page title (i.e. what you see in the web browser title bar/tab heading). Make this short and simple. A good idea is to use the format: `ACG - Section - Page stub`

```
::: {.breadcrumbs}
* [ACG](index.html)
* [Section](section.html)
* Page stub
:::
```

This section set the 'breadcrumbs' - the navigation links above the title. The first bullet should always be the ACG homepage (`index.html`). The second bullet should be the section (Workflow, Style, Output, Resources) and linked to the relevant file. The third bullet should be the page - keep this simple, ideally match it to the page stub you used for `page_title` above. The third bullet shouldn't be linked to anything as it describes the current page you are on.
